Mercedes showed a AMG GT3 race car with a 600hp V8 engine that screamed like a banshee as it rolled on stage to wild applause during its debut; Ferrari unveiled the turbocharged and (relatively) efficient $223,000 488GTB; Lamborghini showed an extended version of its Aventador called the LP 750-4 Superveloce (Aventador SV for short). As if the Aventador wasn’t aggressive enough.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">You love fast cars. So do we.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Today, some muscle cars can be found for relatively affordable 
            prices—although they’ll likely need a 
            lot of TLC (like this ’66 Barracuda for $5,500). 
            Mint-condition models are another story; among the most expensive muscle cars ever sold are a 1967 L88 Corvette Convertible, 
            1971 Hemi Cuda Convertible 4-Speed, a 1967 
            Chevrolet Corvette L88 2-Door Coupe, 
            and a 1962 Shelby Cobra CSX2000 which sold for $3.2 million, $3.5 million, $3.85 million, and a whopping $13.75 million, respectively.

            Emissions and other regulations would tame muscle cars in the 1980s, b
            ut these aging beasts of the road still come with some surprising stories 
            as well as some surprising horsepower—and, as always, 
            total badassery..</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">With its six-speed manual transmission and wooden cue-ball shift knob, it’s understandable why many call the Carrera GT the last of the analog supercars. Absent the sophisticated safety systems of today’s latest-and-greatest, the mid-engined GT is a thrill-ride offering a taste of what might have been had Porsche set the GT’s sights on the racetrack.

            A 5.7-liter V-8 develops 603 hp and has a sound like no other Porsche engine ever made. The Carrera GT does not suffer fools, requiring skill when engaging its sensitive clutch and commanding respect when managing the rear-wheel horsepower. Its shape, the handiwork of Porsche’s then head designer Harm Lagaay, seems timeless—and almost understated—today. A total of 1,270 units were made between 2004 and 2007.  </p>
